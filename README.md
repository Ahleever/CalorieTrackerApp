Calorie Tracker Application

A desktop calorie tracking app built with Python and Tkinter, featuring user authentication, data persistence via SQLite, and a simple, clean interface for logging meals and calorie intake. 
Our project aims to help users track their calorie intake and then recommend possible exercises to help users effectively burn off those calories. Users can input their personal metrics and daily caloric intake, allowing the system to provide personalized recommendations aligned with their fitness goals, whether weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance. By combining nutrition tracking with exercise suggestions, the app promotes healthier and sustainable habits. Our approach leverages a calorie database, an exercise recommendation tool, and user friendly UI accessible to all. In the future, the app could be integrated into wearables to further advance health metrics.
